    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and 
        web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone 
        technologies for the World Wide Web.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents 
        into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
        included cues for the appearance of the document.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects 
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
        links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
        Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. 
        Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include 
        other tags as sub-elements. 
        Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior 
        and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web 
        Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS 
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
