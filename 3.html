    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, 
        interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. 
        It is a language that is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and 
        multi-paradigm.
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web.
        JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. 
        The vast majority of websites use it,[10] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
        engine to execute it.
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative 
        (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, 
        arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, 
        such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment 
        in which it is embedded.
        Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many 
        other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web 
        programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript 
        available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
        The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or 
        additional libraries. Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
        Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and 
        respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; 
        JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.
